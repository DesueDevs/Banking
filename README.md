## Purpose of this repository
I am developing this banking web app that showcases my personal comprehension of cybersecurity. This project's purpose is to both give me hands-on experience with cybersecurity concepts and serve as a timeline that shows my growth in my programming ability and my implementation of cybersecurity.

### Displayed Concepts
- The use of hashing in the form of SHA256. Using hashing makes the storing of user credentials such as passwords secure.
- Proper logging techniques. By logging user actions to a reasonable level, it allows a cybersecurity professional to utilize SIEM tools to effectively look for potential attacks on the system.

### Update Timeline
logging, hashing, basic account creation/management functions without any gui - 6/20/25
